NHDS solves the linear hot-plasma dispersion relation based on the Vlasov-Maxwell set of
equations.

NHDS has the following requirements:

    make
    Fortran 90 compiler
    HDF5

Compile the code by executing

    mkdir obj bin
    make

in the main directory. Then run NHDS with

    ./bin/NHDS

The plasma and numerical parameters are set in the file src/parameters.f90, while the
numerical execution and output are managed in the file src/NHDS.f90.
The code requires the folders src, bin, and obj in the main directory.
